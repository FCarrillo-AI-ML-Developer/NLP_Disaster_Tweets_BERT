# Kaggle - Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets
Natural disasters get announced on social media platforms like twitter. Identifying such tweet can support first responders to take action against natural disasters. However, with so many many tweets out there it is a challenge to get through all of them, and some messages may be ambiguous as they use language that could indicate a disaster event.
Hence, in this project 10,000 hand classified tweets will be used to train a machine learning model so that it can classify 'real' natural disaster announcements from 'fake' disaster tweets.
